# Installation and Configuration of Content SDK

To create content for Kino, you need to install the **Content SDK**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To work with the Content SDK, you must install [Unity](../UnityInstallation/UnityInstallation.md) first.

## Downloading the Content SDK

Download the latest release of the [Content SDK](https://github.com/trbflxr/kino_content_sdk/releases/latest).

After downloading, extract the archive to a convenient location.

## Configuring the Content SDK

Specify author information. This information serves as a kind of signature and will be added to all resources.

> [!NOTE]
> You only need to fill in author information once.

Edit the `__author_meta` file, then click **Validate** to ensure the data is correct.

Refer to the guides to obtain your [SteamID](../GetSteamID.md) and [DiscordID](../GetDiscordID.md) if you're unsure how to do it.
