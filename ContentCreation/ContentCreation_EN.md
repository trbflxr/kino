# Creating Content
UGC content is an important part of Kino and CarX.

Our tools and mod allow you to create and load the following types of UGC content:

### Custom Car Parts (KNPP)

The custom parts system expands CarX car customization.

KNPP allows you to upload not only parts for existing categories in the game, but also adds new ones, such as chassis, interior, brakes, etc.

### Custom Objects (Resource Packs / KNCO)

The custom objects system allows you to load any models into the game and place them on cars or tracks.

Models can be either static or interactive, with features like painting, key bindings, and other additional functionality. You can load anything Unity allows you to bundle. Learn more about creating custom objects at the link below.

### Garages

Custom garages serve as a great replacement for the vanilla garage.

You can create garages with flexible settings for object groups, light sources, various spawn points, and much more.

### Maps

Custom maps allow you to expand the map list in the game and diversify it even more.

Kino supports loading the following types of maps:
* KNMap
* OBJ (Legacy)
* CFMap (Legacy)

Custom maps can also be interactive and change depending on Kino weather, as well as the time of day.  
Guides for creating maps can be found at the link below.

### Sticker Packs

The sticker pack system allows you to add any images into the game as stickers.

Currently, sticker packs are available only to a limited group of people. If you are a sticker pack creator, you already have access to the guide and tools.
